# Instructions (Pre file generation step)
1. With a focus on a test driven development, mvp, and vertical slice methodology, tracer bullet methodoldy, generate 5-15 questions that clears ambiguity, clarity must be > 95%, give me the 3 best suggestions numbered. so i can just choose one of them. Focus on but not limited to:
   1. **System design** is the process of defining architecture, components, and data flow
   2. data structures
   3. state management
   4. relationships
   5. areas of abstractions
   6. data flow
   7. separation of concern (eg. business logic and ui state)
   8. storage
   9. Centralize State Management
   10. Extract Business Logic into Services
   11. performance optimizations
   12. remote storage planning
   13. data interfaces for key features
   14. etc. 
   15. Dont limit it to those areas but they are critical to get correct in order to start the system architecture.
2.  Draft initial data structures and interfaces upfront to prevent data inconsistencies in later phases
3. from these user stories, generate process flow diagrams in mermaid format into logical and related sections

> MVP = fast to build, cheap to run, and easy to maintainâ€”perfect for a paid, zero-to-one Lean MVP.
