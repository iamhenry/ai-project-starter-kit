# Instructions (Pre file generation step)
1. With a focus on a test driven development, mvp, and vertical slice methodology, generate 5-15 questions that clears ambiguity, clarity must be > 95%, give me the 3 best suggestions numbered. so i can just choose one of them. Focus on but not limited to:
   1. data structures
   2. state management
   3. relationships
   4. areas of abstractions
   5. data flow
   6. separation of concern (eg. business logic and ui state)
   7. storage
   8. Centralize State Management
   9. Extract Business Logic into Services
   10. performance optimizations
   11. remote storage planning
   12. data interfaces for key features
   13. etc. 
   14. Dont limit it to those areas but they are critical to get correct in order to start the system architecture.
2.  Draft initial data structures and interfaces upfront to prevent data inconsistencies in later phases
3. from these user stories, generate process flow diagrams in mermaid format into logical and related sections
