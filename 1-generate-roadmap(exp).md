// My Notes
- think about how the roadmap steps will be affected by TDD (writing tests first) and if it makes sense to me
- if it doesnt, restructure the milestone slices to focus on logic first ‚Üí implementation (follow unit ‚Üí integration tdd flow)
- this new  Tracer Bullet Vertical Slice Method focuses on one core journey or user story that's chord to the MVP
(ex. # Core Flow Home: (Conversation List) ‚Üí FAB ‚Üí Capture/Gallery ‚Üí Image Processing ‚Üí New Conversation View (with Receipt Component showing parsed items`)

# HIGHLY Experimental Roadmap.md Parallel Task Execution

## Purpose
1. Break down work into granular tasks
2. Define clear interfaces (contracts)
3. Facilitate parallel development
4. Minimize integration conflicts

## When to Use
- Starting a new software project and needing a comprehensive development plan.
- Planning projects where tasks will be delegated to multiple developers or AI agents simultaneously.
- When aiming to reduce merge conflicts through contract-first development and parallelizable task structures.
- To ensure consistency and clarity in roadmap documentation across different projects.

# Instructions

- Review and analyze the `Required` documents (e.g., User Stories, Overview).
- Decompose the project into a step-by-step development plan following the **Vertical Slice Phasing Model** outlined below.
- **Prioritize breaking down tasks into the smallest, most independent units possible to enable parallel execution by AI agents and support frequent, small integrations/merges.**
- Break down complex tasks into subtasks with a complexity scale (1-5, where 5 is very complex).
- **Emphasize 'Interface-First' or 'Contract-First' development.** Define data structures (e.g., mock data, TypeScript types), API signatures (e.g., OpenAPI specs for backend), and component prop types *before* dependent tasks are assigned. These contracts are crucial for minimizing merge conflicts when multiple agents work concurrently.
- Generate a new file in `_ai/docs/ROADMAP.md`.

## Parallel Execution Documentation

### REQUIRED SECTIONS FOR ROADMAP:
Include these sections in every generated roadmap to enable clear parallel task execution:

#### 1. Parallel Execution Guide Section
Add immediately after the Overview section:
```markdown
## Parallel Execution Guide

### Phase Dependencies
- Phase 1 (Tracer Bullet) ‚Üí Phase 2 (Expansion) ‚Üí Phase 3 (Hardening)

### Milestone Parallelization
- **Phase 1**: Milestones are typically sequential as they build the core end-to-end flow.
- **Phase 2**: Milestones for different vertical slices (e.g., M2: Real OCR, M3: Settings UI) can often run in parallel after the core slice is stable.
- **Phase 3**: Milestones (e.g., M4: Animations, M5: Analytics) can almost always run in parallel.

### Task Symbols
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **BLOCKING** - Must complete before other tasks can start
- üîÑ **PARALLEL** - Can run simultaneously with other tasks
- ‚úÖ **DEPENDENT** - Requires specific prior task completion
```

#### 2. Task Execution Plans
For each milestone, include execution syntax directly in the milestone header showing parallel opportunities:
```markdown
### Milestone X: [Milestone Name]
**Task Execution Plan: Task 1 ‚ö†Ô∏è ‚Üí Task 2,3 üîÑ (parallel after Task 1)**

## Phase-Specific Guidance

### Guiding Principle: Build in Vertical Slices, Not Horizontal Layers

The roadmap must be structured around delivering thin, end-to-end user functionality in each phase. We will de-risk the project by building and testing the most critical, interactive user journey first.

### Phase 1: The Tracer Bullet (Core Functional Slice)
- **Objective:** Build the thinnest possible, functional slice of the project's **single most critical user journey**. This slice must connect all necessary architectural layers (e.g., UI -> API -> Service) to prove the concept works end-to-end.
- **Method:** To achieve speed, this phase should aggressively use in-memory state, mocked API responses, and hardcoded data *within* the functional pipeline. The goal is interactivity, not feature completeness or data persistence.
- **Outcome:** A developer can use a primitive but complete version of the core feature, validating the riskiest architectural and user-experience assumptions immediately.
- **Handling Multiple Core Flows:** If the application has more than one critical user journey, the planner must force a prioritization to select a **single** journey for the Phase 1 Tracer Bullet. The remaining core flows become the top-priority milestones for Phase 2. Use the following criteria to decide:
    1.  **Dependency:** Does one flow require the output or existence of another? (e.g., A "view item" flow must precede a "purchase item" flow). Choose the prerequisite flow first.
    2.  **Risk:** Which flow contains the most significant technical or usability unknowns? Build the riskiest one first.
    3.  **Core Value:** Which flow is most central to the app's unique value proposition? Build that one first.

### Phase 2: Service Integration & Feature Expansion
- **Objective:** To evolve the Phase 1 Tracer Bullet into a robust, production-ready feature and then systematically build out the remaining critical user journeys of the application.
- **Prioritization Hierarchy (MUST be followed in this order):**
    1.  **Stabilize the Core Slice:** Replace all mocks from Phase 1 with real services and add necessary persistence (e.g., database storage). This makes the initial feature complete.
    2.  **Implement Subsequent Core Flows:** Build out any other critical user journeys that were deferred from Phase 1. These should be tackled in a logical, dependency-first order.
    3.  **Expand with Secondary Features:** Once all core journeys are functional, build out supporting features (e.g., settings screens, ancillary content feeds, user profiles).

### Phase 3: Production Hardening & Polish
- **Objective:** Focus on non-functional requirements, user experience enhancements, and business-logic integrations now that the core features are validated.
- **Tasks Include (Examples):**
    - **UI/UX Polish:** Animations, advanced styling, accessibility improvements.
    - **Performance & Security:** Optimization, error monitoring, rate limiting, security audits.
    - **Business Logic:** Subscription/monetization integration, analytics, user onboarding tours.
- **Outcome:** A feature-complete, robust, and delightful application ready for launch.

# Requirements

- `USER-STORIES.md`
- (Potentially: `API-CONTRACTS.yaml` or `DATA-MODELS.md` if available upfront for later phases)

---

# Style Guide

### Structure & Formatting
- Use headers for section titles.
- Keep milestone descriptions concise and action-oriented.
- Use bullet points for Data Flow and Acceptance Criteria.
- Use step numbering for Step-by-Step Tasks.
- Reference file paths and contract documents explicitly to ensure clarity.

### Naming Conventions
- Use `Phase X: [Phase Name]` for broader project stages (e.g., Phase 1: The Tracer Bullet).
- Use `Milestone X: [Milestone Name]` to segment major goals.
- Milestone Naming Rule: Name milestones after the functional outcome they achieve (e.g., "Minimal End-to-End Chat Loop" or "Real-Time OCR Integration"). **Consider grouping parallelizable feature sets or component groups into distinct milestones within the same phase to facilitate concurrent development.**
- Keep file names and paths consistent across projects (e.g., `mocks/[feature].js`, `contracts/api.yaml`).

### Task Complexity Ratings
- 1-2: Simple UI tasks, minor adjustments, implementing against a well-defined contract.
- 3: Mid-level complexity such as basic API integrations (consuming or implementing a defined endpoint).
- 4-5: High-complexity tasks like complex state management, defining new core data structures/API contracts, performance optimization.
- Ensure tasks are broken down at least 3 levels deep. **Even tasks with higher overall complexity (4-5) should be decomposed into smaller, independent sub-tasks (ideally 1-2 complexity each) suitable for individual assignment by an agent and frequent integration.**

### Milestone 1: [Milestone Name - e.g., "End-to-End Recipe Generation Loop"]
**Task Execution Plan: ‚ö†Ô∏è Task 1 ‚Üí ‚ö†Ô∏è Task 2 ‚Üí ‚úÖ Task 3**

Objective: Enable a user to enter an ingredient and receive a recipe name from a 'dumb' API, proving the entire UI-to-API-to-UI communication loop works.

Dependencies & Parallelization:
- **BLOCKS**: All other milestones (this proves the core concept).
- **BLOCKED BY**: None (starting milestone).
- **PARALLEL WITHIN**: None (this is a sequential build of the core slice).
- **PARALLEL WITH**: None.

Data Flow:
- User input from a single screen triggers an API call to a 'dumb' endpoint that returns a hardcoded, structured response. The UI then displays this response.
- API contract defined for `/api/generate-recipe` (request: `{ ingredients: string[] }`, response: `{ recipeName: string }`).

Acceptance Criteria:
- User can input text into an ingredient field and click a "Generate" button.
- A network request is successfully sent to the `/api/generate-recipe` endpoint.
- The API endpoint returns a successful, hardcoded response adhering to the defined contract (e.g., `{ recipeName: "Mock Chicken and Rice" }`).
- The UI updates to display the recipe name from the API call.

**Tasks**:
- [ ] 1. ‚ö†Ô∏è Define API contract and create the 'dumb' API endpoint
  - [ ] 1.1. Create the API route file `app/api/generate-recipe+api.ts`.
