i want you to create a new file called `MEMORY.md` (in `Context Bank` directory) to store lessons in there. the format should be in a timeline structure, with the most recent one at the top. it should include lessons from this entire conversation so that we dont encounter them again in the future

follow this format

```
# MEMORY.md

## [DD-MM-YYYY HH:MM AM/PM] Lesson Title
**Context:** [Brief description of when/why this lesson was learned]  
**Lesson:** [List key takeaway, decision, or fix]  
**Related Methods/Concepts:** [List of methods, functions, or topics involved]  
**Future Improvements:** [List how the workflow/conversation could be optimized]
